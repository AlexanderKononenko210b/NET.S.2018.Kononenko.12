# NET.S.2018.Kononenko.12

Perform refactoring of the class (in order to reduce the repetition code) in Euclid's algorithms 
(refactoring is possible only when the entire method is in the same class!). 
The interface of the class should not change. Check the work of existing unit tests.

In a class with a sorting algorithm that is not a rectangular matrix, accepting 
as a comparator the interface IComparer <int []> add a method that takes as a parameter
the delegate-comparator that encapsulates the comparison logic of the rows of the matrix. 
Test the work of the developed method using the matrix sorting example, using the previous comparison criteria. 
The class can be implemented in two ways, "closing" in the first variant the implementation of the sorting 
method with the delegate for the method with the interface, in the second - vice versa.
